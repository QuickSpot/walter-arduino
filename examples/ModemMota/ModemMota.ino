 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * This file contains a sketch that updates the modem firmware.
 * The current included fat.img contains release version LR8.2.1.0-61488.
 * 
 * How to use?
 * 1) compile and upload sketch - use partition scheme 16M Flash (2MB APP/12.5MB FATFS)
 *    and also set option erase all flash before sketch upload to Enabled
 *    in tools menu
 * 2) run this command from the sketch folder (terminal or command prompt;
 *    on windows it will be COMx instead of /dev/ttyACMx):
      esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x410000 fat.img
 *
 * To update the mota.dup file to a newer dup file:
 * run a MOTA update through BlueCherry Lite,
 * and after the update is ready, use esptool to obtain the new filesystem image
 * which you can update in the repo and use on offline Walters
 * using esptool write_flash above.
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 read_flash 0x410000 0xbe0000 fat.img
